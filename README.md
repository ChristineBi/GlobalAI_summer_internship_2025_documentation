# GlobalAI 2025 Summer Internship Documentation by Christine Bi

* CPIA Data Processing and Visualization: This folder contains scripts and datasets used to merge country-region data with mineral information and visualize CPIA–IDA relationships across multiple years. The cpia.py script automates the data merging process and combines yearly CPIA–IDA scatter plots into one comparative visualization.

* financial_data_fetching.py: This Python script automates the collection of global financial statement data (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) for publicly listed companies worldwide using the EOD Historical Data API. It is designed to fetch and process all common stock tickers from every exchange and store results in a unified CSV file for large-scale financial analysis. It is designed to run safely over multiple sessions, automatically resuming where it left off, and logs both successful and failed ticker downloads. The output is too big to upload, and can be found here : (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1noAnwVC9ZTWmKzEA7934sTF64KgJega2).

* Mineral Data Processing: This folder contains an R script that processes and integrates commodity and mining data for the final analysis. It includes ranking and scoring countries by their mining dependency, calculating summary statistics for countries' commodity dependence, commodity data cleaning, financial metrics and data organization, and data integration. Input files and output files are stored in separate folders. 

* The final dataset (see (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dVBIsG2zgk_rNHIUePx5eSI_Oaf5KH0IFX0Pg_qHS1g/edit?usp=sharing)) was created collaboratively by Christine Bi, Andy Chen, and Raymond Gao. Most data were gathered and verified manually from official sources, databases, policy reports, and reliable news outlets. No automated data collection scripts or code were used for this portion
