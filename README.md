# GlobalAI 2025 Summer Internship Documentation by Christine Bi

* CPIA Data Processing and Visualization: This folder contains scripts and datasets used to merge country-region data with mineral information and visualize CPIA–IDA relationships across multiple years. The cpia.py script automates the data merging process and combines yearly CPIA–IDA scatter plots into one comparative visualization.

* financial_data_fetching.py: This Python script automates the collection of global financial statement data (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) for publicly listed companies worldwide using the EOD Historical Data API. The script is designed to fetch and process all common stock tickers from every exchange, store results in a unified CSV file for large-scale financial analysis, and automatically resume progress if stopped or interrupted. It’s designed to run safely over multiple sessions, automatically resuming where it left off, and logs both successful and failed ticker downloads. The output is too big to include here, and can be found within the final data spreadsheet.
